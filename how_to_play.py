How To Play

The computer will display the word you need to guess as a series of dashes,
with each dash representing a letter in the word. For example, if the word is 'apple,' you might see '_ _ _ _ _'.

Guess what you think might be in the word. Type your guesses on the dashes provided.

Feedback from the Computer: After you guess a letter, the computer will tell you if the letter is in the word or not by filling in the blanks. 
If the letter is in the word, it will reveal its position(s) in the word. 
If not, it will display a message indicating that the letter is not in the word and will draw part of the Hangman.
This will continue until the Hangman has being fully drawn. At this point you lose

However, if you guess the word correctly before the Hangman is fully drawn, you win! 

Play Again: You will have to run the program again to play again """)
